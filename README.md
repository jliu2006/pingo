Identifying Thermokarst Lakes in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Using Discrete Wavelet Transform--Based Deep Learning

One of climate change’s less-visible consequences is rapid permafrost thaw
(Lara, 2022). Not only does thermokarst terrain serve as a prominent indicator
of permafrost thaw, but landforms such as thermokarst lakes emit significant
amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs), specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) and
methane (CH4) (Zandt, Liebner, & Welte, 2020). Acquiring accurate predic-
tions of these landforms would inform more precise global climate models. How-
ever, due to the diversity of their characteristics and the difficulty associated
with collecting widespread field data, thermokarst terrain can be difficult to clas-
sify. To combat these difficulties, in this research, we explore the degradation
of permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) region through the classi-
fication of thermokarst lakes and develop a discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
based dual input deep learning (DL) model with a convolutional neural net-
work (CNN) to automatically classify and accurately predict thermokarst lakes
with area between 0.2 and 0.5 km2, a range of lakes previously excluded from
many assessments due to issues in satellite data. We created a new 3-way tensor
dataset based on raw image data for more than 500 Sentinel-2 satellite lake im-
ages and decomposed those images using state-of-the-art M -band DWTs. We
also incorporated non-image feature data for various climate variables. These
methods significantly improved our model’s performance.
